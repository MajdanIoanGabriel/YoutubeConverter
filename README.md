# Youtube Converter

This project is made using C# and .NET, and compiled using Visual Studio.

## How to use
  - open the .sln file in Visual Studio
  - build and run
  - paste the youtube video link from your browser into the input, then click convert
  - when prompted, choose where to save the .mp3 file (you can change the filename if you want)
  - wait for the .mp3 file to download, when it's ready the page will change (just be patient for a bit)
  - now you can play the .mp3 file you downloaded right in this app
  - you can also choose to convert another file, just by pressing 'Convert another'
